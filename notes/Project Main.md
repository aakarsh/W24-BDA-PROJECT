### Starting Point

* MEG-MASC data from [[Introducing MEG-MaSC a high- quality magneto-encephalography dataset for evaluating natural speech processing.pdf]]
#### Data Set Analysis

- [ ] Check if raw MEG data is available. 
- [ ] Check if text version of data is available
- [ ] Check if text and MEG data is "linked" 
	- [ ] Do we know at which point in the text a given MEG measurement was made ? 

AN:
- [ ] How do I make MASC available on the cluster ?
- [ ] How do I plot alignments ? 
- [ ] How to visualize and categorize surprisals ? 
#### Literature Review

- [ ]  Start reading [[Large Language Models Are Human-Like Internally.pdf]]
-  [  ] Look at surprisal estimates from *early-decoding* layers
- [ ] Focus on next-word probabilities from **final layers**.
- [ ] Look for **derived variables** from MEG measurement which track **next-word surprisal**

#### Main Practical Project Work

* [ ] MEG-data subset which correlate with surprisal. 
* [ ] Extract processing difficulty predictors: 
	* [ ] Frequency
	* [ ] For text subset.
